# CRUD_Exercise
Repository for the CRUD exercise with Java, Spring boot, MySql

This project make a complete CRUD, BackEnd developed with Java and its framework SpringBoot, Database with MySQL and front end Html, Css and javascript, where the 
request to the back end are made by fetch

To run the project must go to the route "CRUD_Exercise/src/main/resources/DB_script/" or "https://github.com/JonathanPinilla/CRUD_Exercise/tree/master/src/main/resources/DB_script"
and with the help of MySQL run the script to create the database.
Once donde that, the next step is to open the project with any IDE (Intellij Ultimate preferably) and run the "CRUD_Exercise/src/main/java/com/sofka/CRUD_Exercise/CrudExerciseApplication.java"

Finally if everything goes well, the application should be locally working at the port 8080. 

To test the application once runing must go to any web browser (Chrome, Edge or any chromium based browser) and go to "http://localhost:8080/index.html" and it should
load the main page and the application would be completely operative.
